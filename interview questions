  JSON is quicker to read and write	                         XML is not.
  JSON can use arrays	                                  XML do not have an array.

  Q>Difference between Html and Html5

    Html	                                                                                                                                          Html5
    Doctype declaration in Html is too longer
    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">	                          DOCTYPE declaration in Html5 is very simple "<!DOCTYPE html>
    character encoding in Html is also longer
    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">	                                                       character encoding (charset) declaration is also very simple <meta charset="UTF-8">
    Audio and Video are not part of HTML4	                                                                                 Audio and Videos are integral part of HTML5 e.g. <audio> and <video> tags.
    Vector Graphics is possible with the help of technologies such as VML, Silverlight, Flash etc	                          Vector graphics is integral part of HTML5 e.g. SVG and canvas
    It is almost impossible to get true GeoLocation of user browsing any website especially if it comes to mobile devices.	JS GeoLocation API in HTML5 helps identify location of user browsing any website (provided user allows it)
    Does not allow JavaScript to run in browser. JS runs in same thread as browser interface.	                             Allows JavaScript to run in background. This is possible due to JS Web worker API in HTML5
    Works with all old browsers	                                                                                              Supported by all new browser.
